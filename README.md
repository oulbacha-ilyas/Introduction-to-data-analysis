data_visualization.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with examples of data visualization techniques
README.md: README file with an overview of the presentation and repository content
Getting Started
To access the presentation slides, simply download the presentation.pptx file and open it using Microsoft PowerPoint or any compatible software.

To run the Jupyter notebooks, you will need to install Jupyter Notebook on your machine. You can download and install it using Anaconda, a popular data science platform. Once installed, navigate to the directory where the notebooks are located and run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
This will launch Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, where you can open and run the notebooks.

Conclusion
This repository provides an introduction to data science and analysis, including best practices for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
